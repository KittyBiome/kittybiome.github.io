<h1>Intake</h1>

<p>We'll start by sending you a sample intake kit. This will be a convenient way for you to collect a small fecal sample from your lovely cat. You will deposit this sample in a sample collection tube and mail it to our sample intake center. There, the sample will be processed with other samples, preparing the input samples to be sequenced (i.e. for the DNA to be read). The result of this process ("library preparation") is a DNA sequencing "library".</p>

<h1>Sequencing</h1>

<p>After preparing the sequencing libraries, we will perform ultra-high-throughput microbial community analysis using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Bacterial taxa present in the samples will be identified by sequencing the V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA.

<p>Sequencing will be performed with minor modifications following the protocols of the Earth Microbiome Project. DNA will be extracted from samples using the MoBio PowerFecal Kit (Carlsbad, CA) with bead beating. DNA concentrations will be standardized across all samples for PCR enrichment and library preparation. After verifying amplification, amplicons will be cleaned with magnetic beads and quantified using a Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen, NY), and pooled in equimolar concentrations for sequencing. The resulting libraries will be sequenced in one Illumina MiSeq lane (paired-end 250 base pair sequencing) according to standard protocols. </p>

<h1>Analysis</h1>

<p>Bacterial species will be identified using the Quantitative Insights in Microbial Ecology (QIIME) and Mothur. We will assess differences in microbiome diversity using various nonparametric multivariate methods in R. Results will be presented in an interactive website that we are developing for this project.</p>
