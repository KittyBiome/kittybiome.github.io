<h1>We love cats! </h1>

<p>We are studying how microbes interact with cat biology, behavior and health. We invite YOU and your CAT to join our study on the microbiome and biology of cats that also include cats living in shelters and wild cats.</p>

<p>An important part of the research we're doing requires the help of animal care organizations. At least 10% of the funds we raise on Kickstarter will be paid to the organizations that are helping us.</p>

<h1>We love science!</h1>

<p><em>Latest technologies.</em> We are using the latest DNA sequencing methods to characterize the microbial diversity in cats.</p>

<p><em>Big data.</em> With your help, we will create the largest database of microbiome data and other data (behavior, health, diet, breed, geography) on cats.</p>

<p><em>Open science.</em> We are committed to open science. While protecting your privacy, we will openly share the results of this study with you. And we will share the database with other researchers who are developing new methods and applications. We will publish our findings in open access journals that everyone can read.</p>

<h1>We value diversity!</h1>

<p><em>Cats.</em> We are launching the largest study of the microbiome of kitties. By looking at all kinds of kitties, from big to small, house cats and wild cats, cats spanning a wide range of health conditions and personalities, we will begin to understand how kitties differ and what makes for happy kitties.</p>

<p><em>People.</em> We are committed to including all kinds of people in science. We believe in citizen science and invite everyone who cares about kitties to join this project.</p>

<p><em>Microbes.</em> A healthy gut microbiome contains a diversity of microbes.</p>

<p><strong><em>Your support can help make kittybiome happen.</em></strong></p>
