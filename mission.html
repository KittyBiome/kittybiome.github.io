<p>We love cats. We are studying how microbes interact with cat biology, behavior and health. We invite YOU and your CAT to join our study on the microbiome and biology of cats that also include cats living in shelters and wild cats.</p>

<p>An important part of the research we're doing requires the help of animal care organizations. At least 10% of the funds we raise on Kickstarter will be paid to the organizations that are helping us.</p>
